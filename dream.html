<h1>My Dream</h1>
<p>My dream is still to open youth and wellness centers for innercity childern.
I believe it is easy to become what you want to be when you can see it.
In the major innercities it gets kinda hard to do so with no role models and drugs all around.
At the youth and wellness centers I will focues on education in STEM and health. Making smart cool again with real people who look,
talk and relate to the childern.

<h1>My Plan</h1>
<p>Each day is another brick layed into builting to foundation to the youth and wellness centers. Since complation of both CyberUp and Savvy Coders, I have spend several hours codin, reading and learning more.
The more I learn the more I'm able to give. One bick at a time, soon it will be.
</p>
<h1>My Code</h1>
<p> My coding knowledge has grown however my use of the knowledge obtain has not. I get stuck at times just as any one eles.. I;m human too. However my thrist for knowledge and my desire to sure has not been forfilled. So often
  I go back and relearn and review anything and everything I can. I haven't met anyone like me yet but I'm sure in time more will see my code, plan, and dream.
