      <h4>After Dreaming, Wake Up & Code</h4>

      <p> I spent a lot of time alone as a child. I would keep myself locked in my room, dreaming of greatness. I only stayed in because what I wanted to be wasn't outside nor was it on tv. So I would just dream. Dreams of a corner office, being a CEO of a major company, owning land, and running a non profit for inner city youth.</p>
      <p>Yes, I know, sounds like big dreams for a child, but my granny told me if my dreams didn't scare me, i wasn't dreaming big enough. So I dream of Greatness.</p>
      </p> However, like most inner city youth, I found greatness could be far. I didn't have the grades to go to a great school so I attended a trade school. Thinking it was better than nothing. In 2006 I gradurated, hoping to becoma a medical assistant, but I end up being a custmore service agent. I was great at sales however not long after getting my first apartment I got laid off. I didn't want to go back home and had to pay student loans, so I began to dance. That was the low, I guess. I bought a house, a car and went back to working in department store. </p>
    <p>Not long after a great friend of mine told me of a resturant opening with great pay. I got the job and was happy. I figured I could just work both job and really live. However, things didn't go as planned. December 2017, I was hit by a car while <em>walking</em> a deliviry. I was stuck. I couldn't move. In that moment I seen the light and remebered my true dream. Not to be good enough, not just be, but to turly LIVE my dream. So I began to code.</p>
